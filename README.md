# About the project
Made back in 2020 as an assignment. The task was to visualize the tower of Hanoi algorithm and this is the result.

If you want to try it without installing Unity and building it yourself, I have a build in the release section.

The project is run on the Unity game engine.

# Bugs I didn't noticed
For some reason I haven't noticed back in 2020 that the algorithm breaks after clicking reseting simulation. I thought it was because I ran the project on a different engine version, but it looks like the build from 2021 has the same issue for some reason ðŸ¤”.
